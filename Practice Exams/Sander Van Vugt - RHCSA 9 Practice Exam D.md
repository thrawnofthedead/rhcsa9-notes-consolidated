    3. One additional 20-GB disk that does not have any partitions installed
    4. Server with GUI installation pattern
2. Create user student with password password, and user root with password password.

Do not register your system with subscription-manager, and remove all references to external repositories that may already exist.

5. Set default values for new users. A user should get a warning three days before expiration of the current password. Also, new passwords should have a maximum lifetime of 120 days.
6. Create users lori and laura and make them members of the secondary group sales. Ensure that user lori uses UID 2000 and user laura uses UID 2001.
